If you were allowed all the privileges of being a citizen without having to follow any of the laws, why wouldn't you? The woman in the video is getting busted in California but she's got a killer argument: she's an Article 4, Free Inhabitant so your silly state laws don't apply to her or her friends. If watching a woman scream at a cop in a high voice isn't your cup of tea today, I'll spoil it for you, she gets arrested anyways. 

But is her argument legitimate? After all Article 4, Free Inhabitant sounds pretty damn serious. 

The answer is no. Her argument is really, really dumb. 

Let's break it down anyways. First of all, she is not referring to Article 4 of the U.S. Constitution, she is specifically referring to Article 4 of the Articles of Confederation. 

So one, the Constitution was ratified by all the original states and supplanted the Articles of Confederation. The state of California was admitted to the Union under Article 4 of the Constitution and was never subject to the Articles of Confederation. Even if we assume that the Articles of Confederation somehow apply, Article 4 very clearly does not create a class of persons exempt from the law. Article 4 was adopted to protect people traveling between states from prejudicial treatment. The crucial language regarding free inhabitants/free citizens/free people: "...shall enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and commerce, subject to the same duties, impositions, and restrictions as the inhabitants thereof respectively..."

What is crucial about this is that it represents the common law principle that a person is afforded rights only when they are subject to the "duties, impositions, and restrictions," what can be collectively called laws. To put it more bluntly, rights apply to you if laws apply to you and vice versa.

Let's leave fantasy land where she would still be subject to the law and go to another fantasy land where she is still subject to the law. The Sovereign Citizen movement is a really dumb really dangerous movement. People that subscribe to Sovereign Citizenship believe they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the states, because they are sovereign. 

What if the state or the country you are in doesn't recognize your sovereignty though? Well thats gonna be a problem because if you're in their territory you are always subject to their jurisdcition. 

So, the moral of the story is, if you ever thought about being a "Free Inhabitant"/"Sovereign Citizen," don't. It's not a thing.
