CBC news [reports](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/killer-whale-infanticide-1.4586867) that researchers observed a male orca killing a newborn so that it could mate with the calf's mother. 

In the past couple of years, there has been sustained efforts by animal rights activists to have the law recognize certain animals as legal people. The argument is that many animals, such as apes and dolphins, are sentient beings that exhibit the traits of a human person and are therefore worthy of the same rights afforded human persons. Corporations are recognized as legal people with legal rights, so it is not without precedent that a non-human should obtain personhood. 

Under the common law a legal person has both rights __and__ responsibilities. So if The Supreme Court of California rules that orcas are legal persons, then under the law an orca would probably be subject to the laws of California as well as protected by them. 

If the scenario above were to happen, say within 12 miles of the California coast within California's jurisdiction, then it actually wouldn't be unreasonable to charge the orca with murder since he is taking the life of another person. 

Where would we imprison such an inmate though? It would definitely be too cost prohibitive to build special prisons just for whales. Luckily there is an institution that already has prisons for whales! 

SeaWorld is facing declining attendance after the fallout of the documentary *Blackfish.* If instead of innocent whales and dolphins held in captivity what if they had prisoners who had committed heinous crimes. Declaring orcas are people could be a win win for everyone. Animal rights activists get to maximize protections for animals, SeaWorld gets its main attraction back, and I get to go visit the park without feeling guilty.
