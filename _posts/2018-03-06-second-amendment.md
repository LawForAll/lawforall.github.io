The topic of gun control is going to get people riled up. Most of your friends on Facebook have probably reduced the entire argument down to an analogy about fat kids and spoons or something about locking up tide pods. Its doubtful we're going to get to any type of meaningful progress if people are just going to argue with memes. So let's try to get a couple things straight.

_You don't get to decide what the Second Amendment means_

Individual citizens do not get to decide what a law says based on their own idiosyncratic interpretation. You can argue about the meaning of 'well regulated militias' till you are blue in the face. It will mean absolutely nothing. Only the courts get to decide what the words in the Constitution mean and the Supreme Court gets the last say. 

_Defending the Second Amendment doesn't mean what you think it does_

Some of you may think that buying a gun, putting an NRA bumper sticker on your car, and yelling at protesting school children counts as defending the Second Amendment. Actually, in Democratic America, Second Amendment defends you! That's right you do not need to defend the Second Amendment because the Constitution and its amendments are designed to defend you from the government. Unless there is a two-thirds vote in in both the Senate and the House of Representatives or two-thirds of all state legislatures agree, the "protection" of the Second Amendment will remain with the courts. 

The way the Supreme Court ultimately protects the Second Amendment is by invalidating laws that are inconsistent to its terms based on the Court's interpretation. So if there is a gun control law that is an "attack" on the Second Amendment, the Supreme Court is duty bound to strike it down. 

_So what does the Supreme Court say the Second Amendment means?_

The most instructive case on the subject is [District of Columbia v. Heller](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/opinion.html). Yes, it is kind of long but everyone who cares about this debate should read the entire Scalia opinion and the dissents.

First of all, about the whole "well regulated militia" thing, Justice Scalia refers to that part as the prefatory clause. In his opinion, that clause is not limiting the, operative clause, "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." Rather, the prefatory clause is just announcing a purprose why the people should have this right. To put it another way, the Second Amendment is not saying, only a regulated militia has the right to bear arms. According to Scalia, it's saying, because a militia is needed, people should have the right to bear arms.

Second, Scalia interprets the operative clause to stand for the inherent right for self defense. 

Debate over right? You can keep and bear arms. Well Scalia makes a couple of things clear. The right to bear arms is not unlimited. 

>"the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose."

Scalia further emphasizes that his decision should not cast doubt on gun control laws that restrict concealed carry, prohibit possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or forbid carry in schools or government buildings. So clearly, the government has the right to limit the use of firearms.

_What about Assault Rifles_

Well that question is not so clear. Scalia basically refuses to create a test for deciding whether a law runs afoul of the Second Amendment. This leaves a lot in the air, including assault weapons. He does cite [United States v. Miller](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/307/174/case.html), a case regarding sawed off shotguns, in saying that the sort of protected weapons are those "in common use at the time." Of course there is no test for deciding what common use really means. To make things even more unclear, Scalia somewhat refers to M-16 rifles as a military weapon. 

Again, it is highly encouraged that everyone read the Heller decision to make sure your meme game is on point.
