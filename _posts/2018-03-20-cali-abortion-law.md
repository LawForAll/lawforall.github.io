Anything having to do with abortions is going to cause controversy. The Supreme Court just heard arguments in the case of *National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra*. Should you be outraged right now? Here's what you need to know.

_What are we arguing about?_

Pro-life clinics in California are upset about the recently enacted Reproductive FACT Act. I suggest reading the [law itself](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB775), its not that long of a read. 

Basically, the law is saying if you fall under the definition of a "licensed covered facility," as defined in the law, then you have to notify your patients that, 
>"California has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services (including all FDA-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care, and abortion for eligible women. To determine whether you qualify, contact the county social services office at [insert the telephone number]."

_So what's the problem?_

So you may be saying, what's the big deal? All you have to do is post a notice with the above quote in the waiting room and you're good, NBD. Well the big deal according to the anti-abortion clinics is that the law is targeted at them and is an infringement on their freedom of speech.

The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates' (NIFLA) evidence that the law is targeting pro-life clinics is based on the legislative history and on the specific exemptions in the law. The [NIFLA Brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/16/16-1140/26997/20180108123359506_2018.01.08%20NIFLAvB%20Brief%20of%20Petitioners%20FINAL.pdf) refers to the sponsor of the bill stating that pro-life centers "pose as full-service women's health clinics but aim to discourage and prevent women from seeking abortions." Furthermore, NIFLA points to the fact that the list of facilities excluded from the law would seemingly leave only pro-life clinics subject to its terms. Private practice doctors, clinics that offer more than pregnancy services, clinics licensed under other provisions such as student health centers or outpatient centers, and abortion clinics enrolled in Family PACT program are all exempt. NIFLA clarifies that pro-life clinics cannot enroll in Family PACT because FAMILY PACT facilities offer abortion drugs.

What this adds up to, says NIFLA, is that the law is specifically trying to promote the government's pro-abortion stance and put words in the pro-life clinics' mouths to promote that stance, a stance they disagree with, which is a violation of free speech. Compels speech, is content based, viewpoint discriminatory. Compelling government interest. Narrowly tailored.

_What does California have to say about this?_

California is basically, all like, you're making this sound way worse than it is, bro (This is how they talk in California). First of all, the state argues, the notice just provides information that is vital for low income women looking for help with their pregnancies. Moreover, the notice is factual and offers no opinion one way or the other. The state also argues that anyone that sees the notice will clearly understand that it's simply a state requirement and not from the clinic itself. And like, the notice is just two lines and a phone number, dude. 

The State of California cites a landmark abortion case in its defense, [Planned Parenthood v. Casey](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/833/case.html). In Casey, the Supreme Court said it may be permissible for a state to require a doctor to give information that is "truthful and not misleading." California also points to [precedent](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/472/846/case.html) from the supreme court stating that just because a profession may entail speech that should not stop government from regulating the profession. 

The state also takes care to distinguish between the types of compelled speech. The court had previously struck down a law where students were forced to salute and recite the pledge of allegiance because it compelled students to "declare a belief." The court had also struck down a New Hampshire law that required the state motto "Live Free or Die" on drivers' license plates because it was compelling the display of an "ideological message." Here, the state argues, clinics are just required to factually notify patients that they can get free or low cost prenatal help and points them to a phone number. There is no ideology being pushed, the state say they're just trying to protect the health of women.

_Got it?_

This is a really quick and dirty look at the case. I would encourage anyone interested to at the very least read the wording of the law itself. The briefs of the parties are a bit long but I think they're worth skimming. The NILFA brief is linked above, you can find the State's brief [here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/16/16-1140/35961/20180220155129758_2018.02.20.ussc.16-1140.jak.state_resp_merits_brief.pdf). Now, go out and argue responsibly.
