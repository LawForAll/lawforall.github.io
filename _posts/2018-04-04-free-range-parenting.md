When I was growing up, every kid walked or rode home from school without supervision, went out into the woods unattended, and messed about near the bayou with no one thinking twice. Nowadays, that type of freedom and independence might land a parent in serious trouble. But Utah is changing that. Utah passed a bill being hailed as a model for the rest of the country, while also making some changes that may not be so roundly lauded. 

Essentially, the bill redefines what constitutes child neglect under the law. Specifically, S.B. 65 adds the following language:
>316          (iv) permitting a child, whose basic needs are met and who is of sufficient age and
>317     maturity to avoid harm or unreasonable risk of harm, to engage in independent activities,
>318     including:
>319          (A) traveling to and from school, including by walking, running, or bicycling;
>320          (B) traveling to and from nearby commercial or recreational facilities;
>321          (C) engaging in outdoor play;
>322          (D) remaining in a vehicle unattended, except under the conditions described in
>323     Subsection 76-10-2202(2);
>324          (E) remaining at home unattended; or
>325          (F) engaging in a similar independent activity.

No need to get deep into any legal mumbo jumbo here, this all sounds pretty reasonable and straightforward. This change seems to be getting near universal support but that support is overshadowing another major change that to some might not be so laudable. 

Immediately preceding the sections above is the following additions:

>310          (i) a parent or guardian legitimately practicing religious beliefs and who, for that
>311     reason, does not provide specified medical treatment for a child;
>312          (ii) a health care decision made for a child by the child's parent or guardian, unless the
>313     state or other party to a proceeding shows, by clear and convincing evidence, that the health
>314     care decision is not reasonable and informed;

You could interpret this to say that parents don't necessarily have to seek out or listen to a medical professional's opinion on treating an ill or injured child as long as the parent's decision is based on religion. There have been countless stories in the news of children dying because their parents opted for so called faith healing when serious medical attention was required or the parents refused critical medical treatment, such as blood transfusions, when such treatment would be against the family's religion. In the majority of states, such acts by parents are treated as criminal acts and have lead to convicted parents being sentenced to serious time and having their children taken away. 

Here, Utah is carving out a religious exemption for cases of medical neglect. The burden would be on the prosecutor to show by "clear and convincing evidence" that the decision was not reasonable and informed. The prosecutor would basically have to show that its more likely than not true that the parent's decision was both not reasonable and not informed. 

That would present an interesting question to a jury: would a hypothetical religious conviction be a reasonable reason to not provide medical care to a child? 

I'm sure there are plenty of court cases out there that might give us a better idea of how other states have dealt with that question but for now the only point I wanted to make is sometimes it's worth it to read laws very carefully.
