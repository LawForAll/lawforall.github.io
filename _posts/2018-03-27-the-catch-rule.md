NFL owners met in Florida today to once again take a crack at deciding what exactly this "catch" thing is in their sport. [The owners voted unanimously](http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/22931857/nfl-owners-approve-new-catch-rule-32-0-vote) to simplify the rule to a three step process: control the ball, be established in bounds, and perform a football move. 

The catch rule, in its previous state, is actually the same process: control, establish in bounds, football move. The big key here is removing the requirement that the player 'survive the ground.' The 'survive the ground' requirement is codified as three notes under [Article 7](https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2017-nfl-rulebook/#article-7.-player-possession) of the NFL Rulebook. 

That sounds simple enough but the official rule has not been revealed so we won't know for sure if it will solve the NFL's longstanding problem until we see it in action. Certainly, it seems as though it will be more understandable for the fans. The lone lingering issue will probably be what is considered a "football move." This is how it is defined under the previous rule:

>A player has the ball long enough to become a runner when, after his second foot is on the ground, he is capable of avoiding or warding off impending contact of an opponent, tucking the ball away, turning up field, or taking additional steps.

The key word in that passage is the word "capable." The rule does not say the player wards off contact or the player tucks the ball away or the player takes additonal steps, it says the player is "capable" of making these actions. This introduces a level of subjective discretion on the part of the referees because they will be deciding what capable means. The issue may then become, "what is a fumble?" because if a player makes a falling or diving "catch" and the ball pops out, a whole game may turn on the question of whether that player was "capable" of making a football move.
