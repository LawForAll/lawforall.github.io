The federal tax code is weird and confusing. You don't need a tax attorney to tell you that. [Jim Tankersley of the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/baseball-tax-law-.html?mtrref=mlb.nbcsports.com) reports that the reforms to the tax code passed by congress last year could lead to player trades being taxed. Until the latest edition of the tax code, player swaps were treated as "exchanges of like-kind property," which were tax deferred, that is, they were taxed at the time the property was sold not at the time it was traded. Now only real estate is exempt from taxation at the time of the exchange since the tax bill needed to offset some of the revenue loss from the deep tax cuts. 

Tankersley presents an interesting question: how do you value a player's contract under this law?

Tankersley uses the Detroit Tigers trade of Justin Verlander to the Houston Astros as an example. Under the new tax law, the Astros would be taxed for the added value obtained by Verlander. How do you measure that added value though? Is it based on his contract versus the three minor league players' contracts he was traded for? Is it based on increased value of the team? In that case, how much would winning a world series increase the Astros tax bill?

Let's consider another example. The NFL draft is next month. Consider your team trades for a bad quarterback, due $16 million dollars next season, to a team for their second round pick. The annual salary for a second round pick in 2017 was between $1 million and $1.75 million. Would that mean your team is taxed on the $15 million dollar "gain"? Should you actually get to claim some sort of deduction because the player is Brock Osweiller and has actually devalued your franchise even further? Should the team be taxed based on the value of the pick itself or the value of the actual player selected? Should the the pick be treated similar to an option? Should your team be taxed on both the value of the pick and the value of the player selected?

The answer, is really no one knows. There will most likely be regulations created to clarify these type of issues but until then lets just wildly speculate.
