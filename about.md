We are licensed practicing attorneys who are trying to present more accurate legal context to the happenings of the day. American society is much more heavily dominated by legal questions than just about any other country on earth. It is clear, however, that the American media has significantly lowered the level of public discourse by presenting legal questions poorly, where accuracy and thoughtfulness have given way to content designed to derive clicks and knee jerk reactions. 

Our hope is that we can let our audience see things through a lawyers eyes without being patronizing and in doing so give our readers a firmer basis for arguing with their neighbors.
